# rearrange-year-in-folder-name
This script renames music folder as I like them: 
  - <b>Artist - Album (Year)</b> becomes <b>Artist - Year - Album ()</b>
  - <b>Artist - Album [Year]</b> becomes <b>Artist - Year - Album []</b>
  - <b>Artist - Album _Year_</b> becomes <b>Artist - Year - Album __</b>
